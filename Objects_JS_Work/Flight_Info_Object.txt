In an intro to objects, the object is to log a new flight with its info to the console.


function main() {
    //take flight number and its status
    var flightNumber = readLine();
    var flightStatus = readLine();
    
    var flight1 = new Flight(flightNumber, flightStatus);
    //assign a flight object to flight1 variable
    
    //output
    console.log('The flight ' + flight1.number + ' is ' + flight1.status)
    
}

function Flight(flightNumber, status) {
    //fix the constructor
    this.number = flightNumber;
    this.status = status;
};
